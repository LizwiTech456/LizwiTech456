## Hi there 👋

I'm Lizwi, a Sound Engineer based in South Africa.

I am a ProTools Specialist & recived this Certification through Avid, the developers of ProTools.
I attaiened a diploma in Audio Technology at The Academy of Sound Engineering in June of 2025.

My Skill set as a ProTools user is very broad but the most important is my understanding of how to use ProTools.
My work flow with this software allows me to deliver high quality projects at a quick rate.
